## 1. Product Vision

**AceClaw** reimagines the AI coding agent experience by leveraging the Java ecosystem's strengths: type safety, concurrency, enterprise maturity, and GraalVM native compilation.

While existing agents like Claude Code (TypeScript/Node.js) and OpenClaw (TypeScript) have proven the interactive AI coding paradigm, AceClaw delivers the same powerful workflow with the performance characteristics, security guarantees, and operational maturity that enterprise environments demand.

### Why Java?

- **Startup performance**: GraalVM native image delivers <50ms startup, eliminating JVM cold start
- **True parallelism**: Virtual threads (Project Loom) enable genuine concurrent tool execution, not just async interleaving
- **Type safety**: Sealed interfaces, records, and pattern matching create self-documenting, error-resistant code
- **Enterprise ecosystem**: Decades of production-grade libraries for logging, monitoring, security, and integration
- **Security by design**: JPMS module encapsulation, sealed class hierarchies, and mature cryptography libraries

### Vision Statement

> AceClaw is a persistent, always-on AI agent that turns your device into an intelligent coding companion. Built on Java with daemon-first architecture, it delivers reliability, security, and speed — running as a system service that learns, acts proactively, and serves all your development tools.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Existing AI coding agents have proven the paradigm is powerful, but current implementations have gaps:

| Problem | Current State | AceClaw Solution |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Slow startup | Node.js agents take 500-800ms to start | GraalVM native image: <50ms startup |
| High memory usage | 80-120MB idle, 200-400MB active | 20-30MB idle, 60-120MB active |
| Limited parallelism | Single-threaded event loop; CPU-bound tools block everything | Virtual threads enable true parallel tool execution |
| Security vulnerabilities | OpenClaw had critical security failures within 48 hours of going viral (API key leaks, prompt injection, malicious skills) | Security-first design with sealed permission types, OS-level sandbox, HMAC-signed memory |
| No type safety | Runtime-only guarantees in JS/TS | Compile-time exhaustive checks via sealed interfaces |
| Enterprise gaps | Limited monitoring, no audit trail, weak credential management | Micrometer metrics, structured audit logging, OS keyring integration |
| Distribution complexity | Requires Node.js runtime + npm install | Single binary download |

## 4. Core Features

### 4.0 Daemon-First Architecture — Device as Agent

AceClaw runs as a **persistent system daemon**, turning your device into an always-on AI agent. The CLI, IDE plugins, and other clients are all thin clients that connect to this daemon.

**Startup Modes**:

| Command | Mode | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `aceclaw` | Interactive CLI | Auto-starts daemon if needed, connects via Unix Domain Socket, opens REPL |
| `aceclaw <prompt>` | One-shot | Sends prompt, waits for response, exits. Daemon stays alive |
| `aceclaw daemon start` | Explicit daemon | Foreground start (for systemd/launchd) |
| `aceclaw daemon --background` | Background daemon | Fork and daemonize, write PID to `~/.aceclaw/aceclaw.pid` |
| `aceclaw daemon stop` | Shutdown | Graceful 15-step shutdown with state persistence |
| `aceclaw daemon status` | Health check | Shows daemon health, active sessions, memory usage |
| `aceclaw daemon install` | System service | Register as launchd (macOS) / systemd (Linux) login service |

**Client-Daemon Protocol**: JSON-RPC 2.0 over Unix Domain Socket (primary) or WebSocket (IDE/remote).

**Why Daemon-First**:
- Sessions survive client disconnects; Agent Teams run in background
- Proactive capabilities: cron tasks (HEARTBEAT.md), memory consolidation, codebase indexing
- Multiple concurrent sessions: CLI + IDE + Web UI simultaneously
- Warm daemon = instant CLI connect (<10ms vs cold-start)
- Background learning: skill refinement and memory optimization during idle periods

**Instance Locking**: File-based PID lock + Unix socket probe, stale lock detection (same as OpenClaw's `gateway-lock.ts` pattern).

**Proactive Agent Capabilities**:
- **HEARTBEAT.md**: Periodic agent health-check tasks (with active hours / quiet hours)
- **Cron jobs**: Persistent scheduled tasks (`~/.aceclaw/cron/jobs.json`) — daily test runs, dependency audits, etc.
- **Background memory consolidation**: Deduplication, pruning, skill proposal during idle time
- **Codebase indexing**: Incremental indexing of active projects during idle periods

**Platform Integration**: macOS launchd plist / Linux systemd user service, auto-restart on failure.

See [research/daemon-architecture.md](research/daemon-architecture.md) for detailed design.

### 4.1 Interactive CLI with Rich Terminal UI

A responsive, keyboard-driven terminal interface with streaming LLM output, markdown rendering, syntax highlighting, and rich interactive components.

- **Picocli** for command-line parsing with GraalVM native image support
- **JLine3** for terminal I/O: line editing (Emacs/Vi), history, tab completion, multi-line input
- **commonmark-java** with custom ANSI renderer for markdown terminal output
- Syntax highlighting for 11+ languages
- Streaming token display, progress spinners, diff viewer, permission dialogs
- Slash commands: `/help`, `/clear`, `/compact`, `/model`, `/tools`, `/undo`, `/exit`

### 4.2 Multi-LLM Support

First-class support for multiple LLM providers:

- **Anthropic Claude**: Opus, Sonnet, Haiku (primary)
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o, o1/o3 series
- **Local Models via Ollama**: Llama, DeepSeek Coder, Qwen
- **Enterprise**: AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI

Features: unified chat completion interface, streaming support, automatic fallback chains, cost tracking, secure API key management.

### 4.3 Tool System

14+ built-in tools with a typed, extensible framework:

| Tool | Description | Permission Level |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| ReadFile | Read files (multimodal: images, PDFs) | Auto-allow |
| WriteFile | Create/overwrite files (enforces read-before-write) | Requires approval |
| EditFile | Exact string replacement with uniqueness validation | Requires approval |
| BashExec | Shell commands with timeout and persistent session | Requires approval |
| GlobSearch | Fast file pattern matching | Auto-allow |
| GrepSearch | Content search with regex and multiline support | Auto-allow |
| WebFetch | Retrieve and process web content | Requires approval |
| WebSearch | Web queries with domain filtering | Requires approval |
| AskUser | Structured Q&A with multiple options | Auto-allow |

Key design:
- Tools defined as **sealed interfaces** with typed input/output records
- **Parallel execution** via virtual threads (independent tools run concurrently)
- Read-before-write enforcement, edit uniqueness validation
- Execution audit logging, timeout/resource limits

### 4.4 MCP (Model Context Protocol) Support

Full MCP client implementation for external tool integration:
- stdio and SSE transports
- Server discovery and capability negotiation
- Tool, resource, and prompt template support
- TLS 1.3, OAuth2 with PKCE authentication
- Input validation with size limits

### 4.5 Conversation Management (ReAct Loop)

The agent follows a proven **ReAct (Reason + Act)** loop:

```
User Query -> Plan -> Reason -> Act (Tool Execution) -> Observe -> Repeat
```

- Conversation history persistence as JSONL transcripts
- Automatic context compression at configurable threshold (~92%)
- Manual compaction via `/compact`
- Deterministic task resume capability
- Multi-turn tool use with result incorporation

### 4.5.1 Task Resume Routing (Deterministic, Isolation-Safe)

Resume behavior for natural-language inputs like `continue` / `resume` must follow a deterministic routing policy that preserves session/workspace isolation.

**Routing Priority (strict order)**:
1. **Current Session Scope**: resume unfinished task in current `sessionId`.
2. **Client-Instance Scope**: if no match in current session, search unfinished tasks under the same `clientInstanceId` and same workspace.
3. **Workspace Scope**: if still no match, search unfinished tasks in the same workspace and require deterministic tie-break.
4. **Fallback**: if no safe/unique match exists, return a disambiguation prompt instead of guessing.

**Deterministic tie-break policy**:
- Prefer foreground task
- Else most recently active (`updatedAt`)
- If still ambiguous, ask user to choose task ID

**Isolation hard constraints**:
- Default behavior MUST NOT auto-resume across workspaces.
- Default behavior MUST NOT auto-resume across client instances (for example CLI vs Web) unless explicitly requested by the user.
- Resume checkpoints must carry at least: `sessionId`, `taskId`, `workspaceHash`, `clientType`, `clientInstanceId`, `status`, `resumeHint`.

**Observability requirements**:
- Emit `resume.detected`, `resume.bound_task`, `resume.injected`, `resume.fallback`.
- Include `sessionId`, `taskId`, `workspaceHash`, and `clientInstanceId` in resume audit payloads.

### 4.5.2 Task Planner (Autonomous Planning & Execution)

For complex, multi-step tasks, AceClaw provides an **autonomous Task Planner** that decomposes user goals into structured, dependency-aware task graphs (DAGs) before execution begins — going beyond step-by-step ReAct reasoning.

**Core Capabilities**:
- **LLM-driven task decomposition**: Analyzes the user's goal and generates a DAG of sub-tasks with dependency ordering, execution strategies, and risk assessment
- **Automatic parallel branch detection**: Identifies independent sub-tasks that can execute simultaneously on virtual threads
- **Memory-informed planning**: Auto-memory patterns (STRATEGY, MISTAKE, PATTERN) directly influence plan generation — avoiding known pitfalls and reusing proven decomposition patterns
- **Adaptive replanning**: When a task fails mid-execution, the planner adjusts remaining tasks while preserving completed work (max 3 replan attempts before escalating to user)
- **Agent Teams integration**: Auto-materializes plan tasks into the shared TaskStore with dependency relationships, enabling team-based execution

**Complexity-Triggered Activation**:
- A `ComplexityEstimator` scores incoming requests using heuristics (multiple files, research needed, refactoring, ambiguity) and memory context
- Simple tasks proceed through the standard ReAct loop; complex tasks trigger upfront planning

**Execution Strategies** (sealed interface, compile-time exhaustive):
- `AgentLoop`: Execute within the main agent's ReAct loop (for tasks needing <5 tool calls)
- `Subagent`: Delegate to an isolated subagent (Explore, General, Plan)
- `AgentTeam`: Assign to a team member with optional plan approval
- `UserAction`: Requires human judgment or external setup

**Autonomy Levels**:
| Level | Plan Behavior |
|-------|---------------|
| **Conservative** | Always show plan and wait for explicit user approval |
| **Balanced** (default) | Show plan, auto-execute low-risk, prompt for high-risk |
| **Autonomous** | Auto-generate and execute; only pause for UserAction tasks |

**Plan Lifecycle**: `Draft -> AwaitingApproval -> Approved -> Executing -> Completed/Failed` (sealed `PlanStatus` interface)

**Post-Execution Learning**: Every plan outcome (success, failure, replan) feeds back into auto-memory as STRATEGY and MISTAKE entries, enabling progressively smarter planning over time.

See [research/task-planner-architecture.md](research/task-planner-architecture.md) for detailed design.

### 4.5.3 Current Implementation Snapshot (2026-03)

The sections above describe the target design. The current codebase has already implemented substantial parts of the roadmap, but several major areas remain intentionally partial:

- **Resume routing**: current implementation supports `session -> workspace` routing. `client-instance` scope and the full audit payload model remain planned work.
- **Task planner**: current implementation supports complexity estimation, LLM-generated plans, sequential execution, and replanning hooks. Full DAG execution, automatic parallel branch scheduling, and Agent Teams integration remain future work.
- **Learning maintenance**: current implementation performs session-close extraction and historical indexing immediately, then runs consolidation, cross-session mining, and trend detection via a deferred maintenance scheduler with time/session-count/size/idle triggers.
- **Security**: current implementation has permission policy and approval gating. OS-level sandboxing, trust-level content sandboxing, and encryption at rest remain roadmap items.

### 4.6 Project Configuration (.aceclaw/ Directory)

```
.aceclaw/
  ACECLAW.md          # Project instructions (team-shareable)
  config.json         # Model, tool, and behavior settings
  mcp-servers.json    # MCP server configurations
  hooks/              # Pre/post execution hooks
  memory/             # Agent memory store
  permissions.json    # Tool permission overrides
```

Configuration hierarchy: System defaults < Global (~/.aceclaw/) < Project (.aceclaw/) < Environment vars < CLI flags

### 4.7 Permission System

Multi-modal permission system balancing autonomy with safety:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Normal** (default) | Prompts for every dangerous operation |
| **Accept Edits** | Auto-accepts file edits, prompts for other ops |
| **Plan Mode** | Read-only operations only |
| **Auto-accept** | Eliminates permission prompts for the session |
| **Delegate** | Coordination-only (for multi-agent team leads) |

Four-tier permission decisions: **AutoAllow** -> **PromptOnce** -> **AlwaysAsk** -> **Deny**, implemented as sealed interfaces for compile-time exhaustiveness.

### 4.8 Hook System

Event-driven automation hooks for deterministic control:

| Event | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| SessionStart | Re-inject context, setup environment |
| PreToolUse | Validation, block dangerous commands |
| PostToolUse | Auto-format, notifications, logging |
| Stop | Quality gates, test running |
| PreCompact | Re-inject critical context |
| TaskCompleted | Verification hooks |

Three hook types: **command** (shell scripts), **prompt** (single-turn LLM), **agent** (multi-turn verification).

### 4.9 Subagent Delegation

Separate agent instances for focused subtasks:

| Type | Model | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Explore** | Fast (Haiku) | Read-only codebase search |
| **Plan** | Inherits | Research for plan mode |
| **General** | Inherits | Complex multi-step tasks |

Custom subagent definitions via Markdown + YAML frontmatter. Independent context windows, persistent memory, foreground/background execution.

### 4.9.1 Agent Teams (Multi-Agent Orchestration)

Agent Teams enable multiple AceClaw agent instances to work collaboratively on complex tasks. Faithfully ported from Claude Code's agent team design with Java enhancements.

**Architecture** (matching Claude Code):
- **Team Lead**: Main session that creates team, spawns teammates, coordinates work
- **Teammates**: Independent agent sessions with own context windows, communicating via typed messages
- **Shared Task List**: Per-task JSON files with auto-incrementing IDs, dependency tracking, and concurrent access via file locking
- **Inbox-based Messaging**: Sealed `TeamMessage` hierarchy (DirectMessage, Broadcast, ShutdownRequest/Response, PlanApprovalRequest/Response, IdleNotification) delivered between agent turns

**Java Advantages**:
- **In-process teammates**: Virtual threads in same JVM (~40% less resources), sharing LLM client pools and using `BlockingQueue` delivery (zero-copy, no file I/O)
- **Dual-mode transport**: `TeamMessageRouter` auto-selects `BlockingQueue` (in-process) or file-based (`FileLock` + `Files.move(ATOMIC_MOVE)`) transport per teammate
- **Sealed interface exhaustiveness**: All 7 message types enforced at compile time
- **In-memory task store**: `ReentrantReadWriteLock` for in-process teams (no file locking overhead)

**Coordination Patterns**: Delegate mode, plan approval, self-claiming, quality gates (hooks), parallel specialists, pipeline, competing hypotheses

### 4.10 Adaptive Skills and Slash Commands

- **Skills**: Model-invoked capabilities auto-matched to user requests (`.aceclaw/skills/`), with **adaptive learning**:
  - **Skill Learning Loop**: Track execution outcomes (success/failure/user correction) -> auto-memory records insights -> skill refinement engine analyzes -> update SKILL.md -> next invocation is smarter
  - **Auto-Generated Skills**: When auto-memory detects repeated patterns (e.g., user always performs X in a certain way), automatically propose a new skill draft; user approves before activation
  - **Skill Metrics**: Per-skill tracking of invocation count, success rate, user correction rate, average turn count; score-based ranking with time decay for auto-invocation priority
  - **Skill Refinement**: After threshold failures or corrections, trigger LLM-powered refinement that analyzes failure patterns and improves skill instructions; version history supports rollback
  - **Skill Lifecycle**: `Draft -> Active -> Deprecated -> Disabled` (sealed interface states)
  - **Persistence**: SKILL.md (Markdown + YAML frontmatter) + JSON metrics sidecar files
- **Commands**: User-invoked slash commands (`.aceclaw/commands/`)
- **Plugins** (post-MVP): Distributable bundles of commands + skills + agents + hooks + MCP configs

## 5. Java Differentiation

### 5.1 Performance: GraalVM Native Image

| Metric | Node.js (Claude Code) | AceClaw (GraalVM Native) |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Cold Start | ~500-800ms | **<50ms** |
| Memory (idle) | ~80-120MB | **~20-30MB** |
| Memory (active) | ~200-400MB | **~60-120MB** |
| Distribution | Requires Node.js + npm | **Single binary download** |
| Binary Size | N/A | **~50-80MB** |

### 5.2 Concurrency: Virtual Threads

True parallel tool execution via Java 21+ virtual threads:

```java
try (var scope = StructuredTaskScope.open()) {
    var fileSearch = scope.fork(() -> searchFiles(pattern));
    var codeGrep = scope.fork(() -> grepContent(query));
    var gitStatus = scope.fork(() -> getGitStatus());
    scope.join(); // All execute truly in parallel
}
```

- **Parallel file search**: Thousands of files searched simultaneously
- **Concurrent tool execution**: 5+ tools running in true parallel
- **Structured concurrency**: Automatic cancellation propagation, no orphaned threads
- **Scoped values**: Zero-cost context propagation (vs ThreadLocal/AsyncLocalStorage)

### 5.3 Type Safety

```java
sealed interface ToolResult permits ToolSuccess, ToolError, ToolTimeout {
    record ToolSuccess(String output) implements ToolResult {}
    record ToolError(String message, Throwable cause) implements ToolResult {}
    record ToolTimeout(Duration elapsed) implements ToolResult {}
}

// Compiler enforces exhaustive handling - adding a new variant
// causes compile errors everywhere it's used
switch (result) {
    case ToolSuccess s -> display(s.output());
    case ToolError e -> handleError(e);
    case ToolTimeout t -> retryOrAbort(t);
}
```

### 5.4 Enterprise Readiness

| Capability | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Modular Architecture | JPMS (Java Module System) |
| Logging | SLF4J + Logback |
| Monitoring | Micrometer + Prometheus |
| Audit Trail | Structured JSON audit logging with HMAC integrity |
| Configuration | Hierarchical config with type-safe validation |
| Testing | JUnit 5 + Mockito + Testcontainers + ArchUnit |

### 5.5 Self-Learning Memory and Adaptive Skills

Advanced memory architecture with Java-specific advantages:
- **Parallel memory retrieval** across all stores using virtual threads
- **Typed memory stores**: Separate stores for patterns, mistakes, preferences, codebase insights
- **HMAC-signed memory files** for tamper detection
- Pattern recognition, automatic memory consolidation, relevance scoring
- **Auto-memory feeds adaptive skills**: Accumulated PATTERN and STRATEGY memories trigger auto-generated skill proposals; MISTAKE memories drive skill refinement; per-skill metrics (success rate, correction rate) with time-decay scoring enable intelligent auto-invocation priority

- `SkillRefinementEngine`, `RefinementDecision` (sealed: NoActionNeeded, RefinementRecommended, DisableRecommended)
- `SkillProposalEngine` (auto-generates skill drafts from detected patterns)

### 6.4 Concurrency Architecture

- **Virtual threads** for parallel tool execution (StructuredTaskScope)
- **Scoped values** for request context propagation
- **Virtual thread blocking patterns** for LLM streaming responses (BlockingQueue-backed StreamSession) and event bus (BlockingQueue per subscriber with virtual thread per subscriber) - no reactive framework needed. Flow API is available for external library interop but is not used internally
- **In-process agent teams** via virtual threads (~40% resource reduction vs separate processes), with dual-mode transport: `BlockingQueue` for in-process teammates (zero-copy), file-based inbox with `FileLock` for cross-process teammates; sealed `TeamMessage` hierarchy for compile-time exhaustive handling of all 7 message types (DirectMessage, Broadcast, ShutdownRequest/Response, PlanApprovalRequest/Response, IdleNotification)
- **ScheduledExecutorService** with virtual thread factory for periodic tasks (health checks, memory consolidation)
- **Circuit breakers** with virtual thread-safe state machines for external service resilience

> **Virtual Threads over Reactive Streams**: Project Loom eliminates the need for reactive programming patterns (Flow, RxJava, Reactor). AceClaw uses simple blocking code on virtual threads instead. This results in simpler, more debuggable code with natural backpressure via BlockingQueue capacity. Flow API is available for external library interop but is not used internally.

### 6.4.1 Infrastructure Architecture

The infrastructure layer provides the operational backbone:
- **Gateway**: Central control plane routing requests from CLI, IDE, and MCP clients via virtual thread-backed connection management
- **Event Bus**: Type-safe internal communication using sealed interface events, dispatched asynchronously on virtual threads
- **Message Queue**: In-process, zero-dependency message queue for decoupled inter-agent communication; supports point-to-point queues, pub/sub topics, request-reply with correlation IDs, dead letter queues, message TTL, and bounded-queue backpressure; uses `BlockingQueue` + virtual threads (consistent with event bus pattern); serves as transport layer for agent team `TeamMessageRouter` with dual-mode delivery (in-process `BlockingQueue` or file-based inbox per teammate)
- **Health Monitor**: Parallel component health checks using StructuredTaskScope, heartbeat system for agent teams (5-minute timeout for crash detection)
- **Scheduler**: Periodic task execution with virtual threads; concurrent scheduled tasks (unlike Node.js single-threaded setInterval)
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fault tolerance for LLM API calls and MCP server communication; automatic failover between providers
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Ordered component shutdown with priority-based participant list and time budgets

### 6.5 GraalVM Strategy

Dual-mode build: native image (primary for CLI) + JVM fallback (for plugins).

| Component | Native Image | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| aceclaw-core | Yes | Reflection-free by design (sealed types, records) |
| aceclaw-tools | Yes | File I/O, process execution - straightforward |
| aceclaw-llm | Yes | HTTP client + JSON serialization |
| aceclaw-cli | Yes | Primary distribution mode |
| aceclaw-sdk (plugins) | No | Plugin classloading requires JVM subprocess |

### 6.6 Plugin System

SPI-based tool discovery with classloader isolation:
- Plugins discovered via `ServiceLoader`
- Each plugin in isolated classloader (shared SDK API packages only)
- When plugins present, spawn lightweight JVM subprocess
- Preserves native image startup for common case (no plugins)

---

## 7. Security Design

### 7.1 Threat Model

Six threat actors identified:
1. **Malicious file content** - prompt injection via source files
2. **Malicious MCP servers** - tool poisoning, credential theft
3. **Compromised dependencies** - supply chain attacks
4. **Malicious repositories** - indirect prompt injection via git artifacts
5. **Local attackers** - session hijacking, credential theft
6. **The agent itself** - acting beyond intended scope

### 7.2 Permission System

Four-tier sealed hierarchy:

```java
sealed interface PermissionDecision permits AutoAllow, PromptOnce, AlwaysAsk, Deny
```

- Compiler enforces exhaustive handling of all permission types
- Tool-level and resource-level permission checks
- Session-scoped caching with configurable expiration
- Enterprise managed settings (read-only, cannot be overridden)

### 7.3 Execution Sandbox

OS-level process isolation:
- **macOS**: Seatbelt (sandbox-exec) - zero additional dependencies
- **Linux**: bubblewrap (bwrap) - namespace-based isolation
- Filesystem isolation: read-only root, writable project directory only
- Network isolation: proxy-based domain allowlist, block private IP ranges, require HTTPS
- Resource limits: execution time, memory, processes, file size

### 7.4 Credential Security

- **Platform-native keyring** via java-keyring (macOS Keychain, Linux DBus Secret Service, Windows Credential Manager)
- **Environment variable filtering**: default-deny with explicit allowlist
- **SecretString type**: custom `toString()` returns `***REDACTED***`, explicit `destroy()` zeroes memory
- **Credential redaction**: pattern-based detection in all logs and context

### 7.5 Audit & Compliance

- Structured JSON audit logging with **HMAC-SHA256 integrity** signatures
- Full session recording for review/replay
- SOC 2 / GDPR compliance mapping
- External log shipping support (syslog, SIEM)

### 7.6 Java Security Advantages

- **Sealed interfaces**: Compile-time exhaustive permission handling
- **JPMS modules**: Strong encapsulation, internal APIs truly hidden
- **ByteBuddy instrumentation**: Runtime security monitoring
- **JFR (Java Flight Recorder)**: Low-overhead security event recording
- **Memory safety**: No buffer overflows, use-after-free, or memory corruption
- **HMAC-signed memory files**: Novel tamper detection for self-learning memory (not in Claude Code or OpenClaw)

### 7.7 Lessons from OpenClaw

OpenClaw suffered critical failures within 48 hours of going viral (January 2026):
- Hundreds of publicly accessible installations leaking API keys
- Prompt injection attacks
- Malicious skills containing credential stealers
- Unrestricted shell command execution

AceClaw addresses all of these with: default-deny permissions, OS-level sandbox, skill/plugin validation, credential isolation, and audit logging.

## 8. Technology Stack

### 8.1 Framework Decision: Plain Java + Picocli (No Quarkus/Micronaut)

| Factor | Plain Java | Quarkus | Micronaut |
|--------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Startup | **10-30ms** | ~49ms | ~50ms |
| Binary size | **~30-50MB** | ~45-75MB | ~40-65MB |
| Framework overhead | **None** | CDI container | DI codegen |
| GraalVM config | **Simplest** | Good | Good |
| Dependencies | **~4MB** | ~15-25MB | ~10-20MB |

Virtual threads work without framework wrappers. For DI, manual constructor injection with `AppContext` class (Dagger 2 if complexity grows).

### 8.2 Key Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Size | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|------|---------|
| Picocli | 4.7.6 | ~400KB | CLI parsing + GraalVM annotation processor |
| JLine3 | 3.27.1 | ~1.5MB | Terminal I/O, line editing, history |
| Jackson | 2.18.2 | ~1.8MB | JSON serialization |
| commonmark-java | 0.23.0 | ~200KB | Markdown parsing |
| **Total runtime** | | **~4MB** | |

### 8.3 Build System

**Gradle Kotlin DSL** with GraalVM native-build-tools plugin.

```bash
./gradlew run                    # Development (JVM mode)
./gradlew test                   # Run tests
./gradlew nativeCompile          # Build native image
./gradlew nativeTest             # Native image tests
```

### 8.4 Java Version

**Target: Java 21 (LTS)** with `--enable-preview` for structured concurrency and scoped values.

Forward-compatible design for Java 25+ when structured concurrency stabilizes.

### 8.5 Testing

- **JUnit 5**: Test framework
- **Mockito 5**: Mocking (GraalVM-compatible inline mock maker)
- **WireMock**: HTTP API mocking (LLM API simulation)
- **Testcontainers**: Integration tests
- **ArchUnit**: Architecture rule enforcement

---

## 9. Frontend / CLI Design

### 9.1 Architecture

```
User Input -> JLine3 LineReader -> Command Parser -> Agent
Agent Response -> Token Aggregator -> Markdown Parser -> ANSI Renderer -> Terminal
```

### 9.2 Terminal Output

| Markdown Element | Terminal Rendering |
|---|---|
| `# Heading` | Bold + color |
| `**bold**` | ANSI bold |
| `` `code` `` | Inverse/background highlight |
| ```` ```code```` | Bordered box with syntax highlighting |
| `> blockquote` | Indented with vertical bar |
| `- list item` | Bullet with indent |
| `\| table \|` | Unicode box-drawing characters |

### 9.3 Streaming

Incremental rendering with `MarkdownStreamBuffer`:
- Text paragraphs: flush word-by-word
- Code blocks: buffer until complete, re-highlight
- Tables: buffer until complete
- Tool calls: inline status indicator, then result

### 9.4 Interactive Components

- **Permission dialogs**: `[y] Allow once  [n] Deny  [a] Always allow`
- **Progress indicators**: Determinate bars + indeterminate spinners
- **Diff display**: Unified diff with ANSI coloring
- **Multi-select menus**: Arrow keys + space to toggle
- **Context indicator**: `[tokens: 12.4k/128k | cost: $0.23 | model: sonnet-4.5]`

### 9.5 Accessibility

- Screen reader mode: simplified output, no animations, semantic text
- Color modes: auto-detect, truecolor, 256, 16, none
- High contrast: WCAG AAA (7:1 minimum contrast ratio)
- Configurable symbols: Unicode or ASCII-only fallback

### 9.6 IDE Integration (Post-MVP)

Shared `AceClawUiAdapter` interface for all UI targets:
- **VS Code**: TypeScript extension via JSON-RPC over stdio
- **IntelliJ**: Kotlin plugin via Platform SDK
- **Web Dashboard** (v2): Javalin-based monitoring with WebSocket real-time updates

## 10. Memory and Self-Learning Strategy

### 10.1 Tiered Memory Model

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                    Context Window (LLM Request)                   |
|  System Prompt (cached)                                          |
|  Injected Memory (project instructions, auto-memory hits)        |
|  Compacted History (summaries of older turns)                    |
|  Recent Messages (last N turns, verbatim)                        |
|  Tool Definitions (available tools)                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+

         ^                    ^                    ^
  Short-term Memory    Medium-term Memory    Long-term Memory
  (conversation)       (session summaries)   (project + auto)
```

### 10.2 Project Memory (ACECLAW.md)

Analogous to CLAUDE.md - hierarchical project configuration:

| Location | Scope | Loading |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `~/.aceclaw/ACECLAW.md` | User-global | Always at launch |
| `.aceclaw/ACECLAW.md` | Project | Always at launch |
| `src/.aceclaw/ACECLAW.md` | Subdirectory | On-demand |

### 10.3 Auto-Memory (Self-Learning)

```java
public enum MemoryCategory {
    MISTAKE,          // "I tried X but Y was correct"
    PATTERN,          // "When user asks X, codebase uses pattern Y"
    PREFERENCE,       // "User prefers approach X over Y"
    CODEBASE_INSIGHT, // "Module X depends on Y, uses pattern Z"
    STRATEGY          // "For task type X, strategy Y works best"
}
```

After each turn, analyze asynchronously on a virtual thread:
- Detect mistakes (tool errors followed by corrections)
- Detect patterns (repeated code structures)
- Track user preferences (corrections, style choices)
- Record codebase insights (dependencies, conventions)

### 10.4 Parallel Memory Retrieval

Java advantage: retrieve from all memory stores simultaneously:

```java
try (var scope = StructuredTaskScope.open()) {
    var projectMemory = scope.fork(() -> projectStore.getInstructions(root));
    var autoMemory = scope.fork(() -> autoStore.retrieve(query, 5));
    var codebaseContext = scope.fork(() -> codebaseIndex.search(query, 10));
    scope.join();
    return new MemoryInjections(projectMemory.get(), autoMemory.get(), codebaseContext.get());
}
```

### 10.5 Context Compression

Three-phase compaction strategy:
1. **Clear verbose tool results** (safe, high token savings)
2. **Summarize old turns** (moderate savings)
3. **Drop irrelevant context** (aggressive, last resort)

Anchor preservation: key architectural decisions, user preferences, and error contexts are never compressed.

### 10.6 Agent Active Memory (P1)

The agent must be able to **actively decide** what to remember during a conversation, not just passively rely on compaction extraction. Three capabilities:

#### 10.6.1 Memory Management Tool

A built-in `memory` tool with three actions that the agent can call during any turn:

| Action | Parameters | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `save` | content, category, tags[], global | Persist a new insight to auto-memory |
| `search` | query, category?, limit? | Search memories using hybrid ranking (TF-IDF + recency) |
| `list` | category?, limit? | List recent memories, optionally filtered by category |

The tool is auto-approved (PermissionLevel.READ for search/list, PermissionLevel.WRITE for save). The agent decides autonomously when to call it — e.g., after discovering a codebase pattern, receiving a user correction, or completing a complex debugging session.

#### 10.6.2 System Prompt Memory Guidance

The system prompt must teach the agent **when** and **how** to use the memory tool:

- After receiving a user correction → save as CORRECTION
- After discovering a codebase convention → save as PATTERN
- After a mistake + fix → save as MISTAKE
- When the user states a preference → save as PREFERENCE
- Before starting a complex task → search for relevant memories
- At the start of a session → memories are already injected via the 6-tier hierarchy

#### 10.6.3 Session-End Memory Extraction

When a session is destroyed (explicitly or via daemon shutdown), the system automatically extracts key learnings from the conversation:

1. Scan conversation history for: tool errors followed by corrections, user corrections of agent output, explicit preferences stated
2. Use heuristic extraction (no LLM call) to identify: files modified, commands that failed/succeeded, patterns observed
3. Store extracted insights to AutoMemoryStore with source `session-end:{sessionId}`
4. Append session summary to DailyJournal

This ensures no insight is lost even if the agent did not actively call `memory save` during the session.

### 10.7 Memory Security

- HMAC-SHA256 signed memory files for tamper detection
- Content sanitization for injection patterns
- Memory files read with `TOOL_UNTRUSTED` trust level
- Max file size limits (50KB per file, 500KB total)
- Directory permissions: `700` (owner only)
