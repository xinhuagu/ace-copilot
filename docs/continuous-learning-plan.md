# Continuous Learning Baseline Plan

## Purpose
This document defines the v1 measurement framework for AceCopilot continuous learning. The goal is to establish reproducible baseline metrics before enabling aggressive autonomous promotion and rollback policies.

This plan aligns with PRD success metrics and the current governed-learning implementation.
Operational controls and rollback procedures are documented in `docs/continuous-learning-operations.md`.

## Current State

Implemented today:
- replay case generation and replay report aggregation
- candidate promotion / demotion / rollback tracking
- draft validation and auto-release guardrails
- baseline collection script and report templates

Still intentionally incomplete:
- some metrics still emit `pending_instrumentation`
- replay dataset governance is still growing
- threshold tuning still requires operator judgment

## Scope
In scope for baseline v1:
- Metric dictionary with formulas and thresholds.
- Collection points and output schema.
- A local baseline collection command.
- A reporting template for before/after comparisons.

Out of scope for baseline v1:
- Real-time dashboarding.
- Provider-specific optimization.
- Automatic threshold tuning.

## Data Sources
- Agent turn outcomes (`StreamingAgentHandler`, session lifecycle).
- Tool runtime statistics (`ToolMetricsCollector`).
- Learning events (candidate updates, promotions, demotions, rollbacks).
- Validation/replay gate outputs.

## Metric Dictionary (v1)
The table below defines the canonical baseline metrics.

| Metric | Definition | Formula | Collection Point | Window | Initial Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `task_success_rate` | Tasks completed successfully | `successful_tasks / completed_tasks` | Session end summary | 7 days | `>= 0.85` |
| `first_try_success_rate` | Tasks that succeed without retries | `first_try_successes / completed_tasks` | Turn + retry tracking | 7 days | `>= 0.70` |
| `retry_count_per_task` | Mean retries per completed task | `total_retries / completed_tasks` | Turn history | 7 days | `<= 0.60` |
| `tool_execution_success_rate` | Successful tool calls ratio | `tool_success_count / total_tool_invocations` | `ToolMetricsCollector` | 7 days | `>= 0.95` |
| `tool_error_rate` | Tool-call error ratio | `tool_error_count / total_tool_invocations` | `ToolMetricsCollector` | 7 days | `<= 0.05` |
| `permission_block_rate` | Permission-related blocked actions ratio | `permission_blocks / action_attempts` | Permission manager events | 7 days | `<= 0.05` |
| `timeout_rate` | Timeout ratio across tools/subagents/tasks | `timeouts / action_attempts` | Runtime failure events | 7 days | `<= 0.03` |
| `learning_hit_rate` | Turn success rate when injected candidates are present | `successful_injection_outcomes / total_injection_outcomes` | Injection audit log | 7 days | `>= 0.40` |
| `promotion_precision` | Promoted candidates that stay healthy post-release | `healthy_promotions / total_promotions` | Candidate lifecycle + outcome feedback | 14 days | `>= 0.80` |
| `false_learning_rate` | Promoted candidates later demoted/rejected as harmful | `harmful_promotions / total_promotions` | Candidate lifecycle engine | 14 days | `<= 0.10` |
| `time_to_promote_p50_hours` | Median time from first seen to promoted | `p50(promoted_at - first_seen_at)` | Candidate store timestamps | 14 days | `<= 72h` |
| `regression_rate_after_learning` | Regressions introduced by learning rollouts | `regressed_rollouts / total_rollouts` | Replay + runtime enforcement | 14 days | `<= 0.10` |
| `auto_rollback_rate` | Rollouts that required automatic rollback | `auto_rollbacks / total_rollouts` | Auto-release enforcement events | 14 days | `<= 0.10` |

## Offline Replay Metrics (A/B)
The baseline requires direct `learning=off` vs `learning=on` comparison on the same replay dataset.

| Metric | Definition | Formula | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| `replay_success_rate_delta` | Success-rate impact of learning on replay | `success_rate_on - success_rate_off` | `>= -0.10` |
| `replay_token_delta` | Token cost impact of learning | `avg_tokens_on - avg_tokens_off` | `<= 200` (budget) |
| `replay_latency_delta_ms` | Latency impact of learning | `avg_latency_ms_on - avg_latency_ms_off` | `<= 500` (budget) |
| `replay_failure_distribution_delta` | Change in failure-type distribution | `L1(failure_dist_on, failure_dist_off)` | `<= 2.50` |
| `token_estimation_error_ratio_max` | Worst calibrated estimator/provider deviation | `max(|estimated*calibration-provider|/provider)` | `<= 0.65` |

Notes:
- `failure_dist_*` is computed over normalized failure buckets (permission, timeout, tool-error, other).
- Replay cases include dual-track token fields (`estimated_tokens`, `provider_tokens`=`usage.outputTokens`) and derived `estimation_error_ratio`.
- `token_estimation_error_ratio_max` must be `measured` and pass threshold for pre-merge acceptance.
- Replay metric aggregation is implemented via `scripts/generate-replay-report.sh`.
- Replay case execution is available via `:ace-copilot-cli:runReplayCases` / `./gradlew generateReplayCases`.
- Replay suite schema + category coverage validation is enforced via `validateReplaySuite`.
- CI-scale replay dataset growth and ownership governance (larger suite lifecycle) is still an ongoing integration track.

## Collection Output Schema
Baseline output should be written to:
- `.ace-copilot/metrics/continuous-learning/baseline-<UTC timestamp>.json`

Top-level JSON sections:
- `metadata`: repo, commit, branch, collection timestamp, command version.
- `collection`: whether tests were run, status, and optional failure details.
- `metrics`: dictionary keyed by canonical metric names.
- `notes`: freeform comments and instrumentation gaps.

## Baseline Command
Use the repository script:

```bash
./scripts/collect-continuous-learning-baseline.sh --run-tests
```

Useful flags:

```bash
# Custom output path
./scripts/collect-continuous-learning-baseline.sh \
  --output /tmp/ace-copilot-baseline.json

# Override a metric manually (escape hatch for missing or incorrect data)
./scripts/collect-continuous-learning-baseline.sh \
  --metric task_success_rate=0.88
```

## Baseline Workflow
1. Ensure clean workspace and stable test environment.
2. Generate artifacts that the collector reads automatically:
   - Run replay: `./scripts/generate-replay-report.sh --input <cases.json>` → `replay-latest.json`
   - Export injection audit: `./scripts/export-injection-audit-summary.sh` → `injection-audit-summary.json`
   - Runtime metrics are exported by the daemon during normal operation → `runtime-latest.json`
3. Run the baseline collection script with `--run-tests`.
4. The collector auto-reads metrics from the above artifacts. Use `--metric` overrides only as an escape hatch.
5. Fill `docs/reports/continuous-learning-baseline-template.md` with generated output.
6. Attach the report to the relevant issue/PR.

## CI Gate Workflow
1. Generate replay report from A/B replay cases:
   - `./gradlew generateReplayCases -PreplayPromptsInput=... -PreplayCasesOutput=...`
   - `./gradlew generateReplayReport -PreplayCasesInput=... -PreplayReport=...`
2. Run hard pre-merge gate:
   - `./gradlew preMergeCheck -PreplayGateStrict=true -PreplayReport=...`
3. Gate fails if replay report is missing, metrics are non-measured, source manifest verification fails, or thresholds are violated.

## Known Gaps (v1)
- Some metrics are not fully instrumented yet and will be emitted as `pending_instrumentation`.
- Replay case/reports are automated; remaining work is stronger dataset governance at scale.
- Outcome writeback, deterministic time-gating (`Clock`), lifecycle cleanup/decay, and concurrency hardening are implemented.
- Remaining work is mostly in stronger release policy packs and richer production-scale replay coverage.
