# Anti-Pattern Pre-Execution Gate

## Goal
Convert learned anti-patterns from passive prompt hints into enforced runtime behavior so the agent automatically avoids repeating known bad paths.

## Scope
- In scope:
  - Pre-execution gate before each tool invocation.
  - Rule model for anti-pattern match and actions.
  - Deterministic override and cooldown behavior.
  - Observability and replay validation.
- Out of scope:
  - Cross-machine synchronization of gate state.
  - Restoring opaque external process handles.

## Why
Current learning artifacts are mostly advisory. The model can still retry known failing paths.
This gate adds execution constraints so repeated non-progressing failures are blocked or penalized before tool execution.

## Architecture
1. Rule Store
- Input: promoted candidates + anti-pattern signals.
- Output: normalized gate rules.
- Storage: JSONL with atomic rewrite.

2. Rule Schema
- `rule_id`
- `scope` (tool/category/tags)
- `match`:
  - `tool_name`
  - `failure_class` (dependency_missing, capability_mismatch, path, etc.)
  - `context_tags` (optional)
  - `min_repeat`
- `action`:
  - `BLOCK`
  - `PENALIZE`
- `fallback`:
  - required next strategy/tool preference guidance
- `failure_types`:
  - structured taxonomy (`dependency_missing`, `capability_mismatch`, etc.)
  - used for robust matching in addition to keyword overlap
- `cooldown_until`
- `created_at`, `updated_at`

3. Runtime Gate Hook
- Hook point: immediately before `tool.execute(...)`.
- Flow:
  - gather call context
  - evaluate matching rules
  - if `BLOCK`: skip execution and return structured gate result
  - if `PENALIZE`: allow execution with explicit warning and fallback hint attached
  - emit `stream.gate` notification (`BLOCK`/`PENALIZE`/`OVERRIDE`)

4. Override Policy
- Explicit runtime override RPC:
  - `antiPatternGate.override.set`
  - `antiPatternGate.override.get`
  - `antiPatternGate.override.clear`
- Override is session+tool scoped with TTL and reason.

5. Lifecycle
- Rule promotion: candidate pipeline -> promoted anti-pattern -> active gate rule.
- Rule decay: cooldown and optional expiration after long healthy windows.
- Rule rollback: automatic on high false-positive rate.
  - false-positive signal source: override-active + successful execution on would-be BLOCK path

## Observability
Emit machine-readable event:
- `stream.gate` with action `BLOCK` / `PENALIZE` / `OVERRIDE`
- Feedback persistence:
  - `.ace-copilot/metrics/continuous-learning/anti-pattern-gate-feedback.json`
  - tracks blocked count + false-positive count per rule
  - replay report now carries:
    - `anti_pattern_gate_false_positive_rate_weighted`
    - `anti_pattern_gate_false_positive_rate_max`

Expose in CLI status:
- active gate count
- latest blocked rule id (short)

## Hard Acceptance Criteria
1. Repeated known bad path is blocked before execution in >=95% replay cases.
2. First blocked response includes:
- reason class
- matched rule id
- fallback next action
3. False-positive block rate remains under agreed threshold in replay.
4. Atomic persistence validated under interruption.
5. Override flow is deterministic and auditable.
6. BLOCK rules auto-downgrade to PENALIZE when false-positive rate breaches threshold.
7. Candidate-backed BLOCK rules auto-rollback when false-positive threshold is sustained.

## Test Plan
- Unit
  - matcher correctness
  - action selection (`BLOCK`/`PENALIZE`)
  - cooldown/expiry
  - override scoping
- Integration
  - repeated failure -> block on next attempt
  - penalty path adds warning but executes
  - user override unblocks only for current task
  - daemon restart preserves gate rules
- Replay
  - track hit rate, prevented-retry rate, false-positive rate

## Rollout
1. Phase 1: `PENALIZE` default, metrics-only for block candidates.
2. Phase 2: enable `BLOCK` for high-confidence classes (`dependency_missing`, `capability_mismatch`, `path`) with kill-switch.
3. Phase 3: full policy with CI replay threshold gate.

## Config
- `antiPatternGateMinBlockedBeforeRollback` (default `3`)
- `antiPatternGateMaxFalsePositiveRate` (default `0.50`)
- env overrides:
  - `ACE_COPILOT_ANTI_PATTERN_GATE_MIN_BLOCKED_BEFORE_ROLLBACK`
  - `ACE_COPILOT_ANTI_PATTERN_GATE_MAX_FALSE_POSITIVE_RATE`

## Implementation Checklist
- [x] Add anti-pattern rule model and persistence.
- [x] Add pre-execution gate evaluator in agent loop.
- [x] Add structured blocked response payload.
- [x] Add override command (session+tool TTL via RPC).
- [x] Add observability event (`stream.gate`).
- [x] Add unit tests for gate + override lifecycle.
- [x] Add persisted false-positive feedback for gate policy adaptation.
- [x] Add automatic BLOCK->PENALIZE downgrade and candidate auto-rollback trigger.
