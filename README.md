AceClaw is the Java implementation of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw) — built from the ground up with security as a foundational principle, not an afterthought. The daemon exposes zero network surface, permissions are modeled as sealed types with compiler-enforced exhaustiveness, and every memory entry is cryptographically signed.

## Security First

AceClaw defends across five dimensions:

### Architecture Isolation

- **Zero network surface** — Daemon listens ONLY on Unix Domain Socket (`~/.aceclaw/aceclaw.sock`). No HTTP, no REST, no WebSocket.
- **Single entry point** — CLI → UDS → Daemon. There is no other way in.
- **Signal isolation** — Daemon runs in a separate process group (`setsid` on Linux, `trap` on macOS), so CLI signals (Ctrl+C) don't kill the daemon or corrupt session state.
- **Session-scoped state** — Each session has isolated conversation history; no cross-session data leakage.

### Sealed Permission Model

The `aceclaw-security` module enforces a 4-level permission hierarchy with compiler-verified exhaustiveness:

```
READ        → auto-approved (file reads, glob, grep)
WRITE       → user approval required (file writes, edits)
EXECUTE     → user approval required (bash commands)
DANGEROUS   → always prompt, never remembered
```

- `PermissionDecision` is a **sealed interface** — `Approved | Denied | NeedsUserApproval`. The compiler enforces exhaustive handling; you cannot forget a case.
- Sub-agents receive **filtered tool registries** — restricted tool sets prevent privilege escalation through nesting.

### Memory Integrity

The `aceclaw-memory` module treats every persisted memory as a signed document:

- **HMAC-SHA256** per entry with constant-time verification — tampered entries are rejected, not silently loaded.
- **POSIX 600** on the signing key file — only the owning user can read it.
- **SHA-256 hashed workspace paths** — workspace isolation without leaking directory names.
- **Mutable fields excluded from HMAC** — `accessCount` and `lastAccessedAt` are intentionally outside the signable payload so reads don't invalidate signatures.
- **3-pass memory consolidation** (dedup → similarity merge → age prune) — prevents memory pollution and unbounded growth.

### Content Boundaries

Prompt injection is an industry-wide unsolved problem — no AI agent has a complete programmatic defense. AceClaw applies architectural mitigations to limit blast radius:

- **System prompt budget** — 150K total character cap + 20K per-tier cap. Tiers exceeding budget are truncated (70% head / 20% tail / 10% marker), lowest-priority tiers first. Prevents memory tiers from consuming the context window.
- **8-tier priority ordering** — Higher-priority tiers (Soul, Managed Policy) override lower tiers. Human-authored content always outranks agent-generated memory.
- **Tool result truncation** — Tool outputs capped at 30K characters (40/60 head/tail split) to limit injection surface from external commands.
- **Managed Policy tier** — Reserved slot (priority 90) for enterprise-managed rules that the agent must follow, loaded from `~/.aceclaw/managed-policy.md`.

> **Planned:** Trust-level content sandboxing (wrapping tiers with trust metadata), taint tracking for agent-generated memories, and memory quarantine for untrusted entries. See [Security Roadmap](#security-roadmap).

### Data Protection

HMAC-SHA256 provides **integrity** (tamper detection), not **confidentiality** — memory files are stored as plaintext JSONL on disk:

- **File-level permissions** — Signing key (`~/.aceclaw/memory/memory.key`) restricted to POSIX 600 (owner-only read).
- **Size governance** — MarkdownMemoryStore enforces 50KB per file, 500KB per workspace. Memory consolidation archives entries older than 90 days with zero access.
- **No encryption at rest** — Memory content is not encrypted. For sensitive environments, rely on OS-level disk encryption (FileVault, LUKS) until native encryption is implemented.

> **Planned:** AES-256 encryption at rest, per-entry key wrapping, key rotation without re-encryption. See [Security Roadmap](#security-roadmap).

## AceClaw vs OpenClaw

| Capability | OpenClaw | AceClaw |
|------------|----------|---------|
| **Language** | TypeScript/Node.js | Java 21 (GraalVM native) |
| **Agent Loop** | External (Pi framework) | Self-implemented ReAct loop |
| **Architecture** | Single process | Daemon-first (persistent JVM + thin CLI) |
| **Concurrency** | Node.js async | Virtual threads (Project Loom) |
| **Memory** | 5-tier (T0-T4), MEMORY.md + daily logs, vector+BM25 search | 8-tier hierarchy, HMAC-signed JSONL, TF-IDF hybrid search, memory consolidation |
| **Security** | SHA-256 dedup, no signing | 5-layer defense: UDS isolation, sealed permissions, HMAC-signed memory, prompt budget caps, data protection |
| **LLM Providers** | Pi SDK (multi-provider) | 7 providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, Together, Mistral, Copilot, Ollama) |
| **Tools** | 50+ via community | 12 built-in + MCP extensibility |
| **Skills** | 700+ community (SKILL.md) | Planned: adaptive skills with effectiveness metrics |
| **Agent Teams** | Not supported | Planned: in-process virtual thread teammates |
| **Type Safety** | TypeScript | Sealed interfaces + exhaustive pattern matching |
| **Startup** | ~500ms (Node.js) | Sub-50ms (GraalVM native image) |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build
./gradlew clean build && ./gradlew :aceclaw-cli:installDist

# Configure
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-api03-..."

# Run (auto-starts daemon)
./aceclaw-cli/build/install/aceclaw-cli/bin/aceclaw-cli
```

Multi-provider support:
```bash
export ACECLAW_PROVIDER="openai"   # or groq, together, mistral, ollama
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

## Architecture

```
CLI (Picocli + JLine3)
  │ JSON-RPC 2.0 over UDS only ← zero network surface
Daemon (persistent JVM, separate process group)
  ├─ Request Router       → method dispatch
  ├─ Session Manager      → per-project sessions (isolated state)
  ├─ Streaming Agent Loop → ReAct loop (max 25 iterations)
  ├─ Permission Manager   → sealed 4-level gate (READ/WRITE/EXECUTE/DANGEROUS)
  ├─ Tool Registry        → 12 native tools + MCP (filtered per sub-agent)
  ├─ Memory System        → 8-tier hierarchy, HMAC-signed, hybrid search
  ├─ Context Compactor    → 3-phase (prune → summarize → memory flush)
  └─ LLM Client Factory   → 7 providers, extended thinking, prompt caching
```

### Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `aceclaw-core` | LLM abstractions, agent loop, tool interface, context compaction |
| `aceclaw-llm` | Anthropic + OpenAI-compatible LLM clients |
| `aceclaw-tools` | 12 built-in tools (file ops, bash, glob, grep, web, browser) |
| `aceclaw-security` | Sealed permission model (AutoAllow / PromptOnce / AlwaysAsk / Deny) |
| `aceclaw-memory` | [8-tier memory hierarchy](docs/memory-system-design.md), hybrid search, consolidation, path-based rules, HMAC integrity |
| `aceclaw-mcp` | MCP client integration for external tools |
| `aceclaw-daemon` | Daemon process, UDS listener, streaming handler |
| `aceclaw-cli` | CLI entry point, REPL, daemon lifecycle |

## Memory System

8-tier persistent memory hierarchy with HMAC-SHA256 signing, hybrid TF-IDF search, and 3-pass consolidation. See [Memory System Design](docs/memory-system-design.md) for the full architecture, tier hierarchy, 21 memory categories, and comparison with Claude Code and OpenClaw.

## Security Roadmap

AceClaw's security posture is iterative. The following items are designed but not yet implemented:

| Phase | Feature | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **S1** | Trust-level content sandboxing | Wrap memory tiers with trust metadata (`trusted` / `user` / `project` / `agent`), differentiated preambles per trust level |
| **S1** | SOUL.md override protection | Prevent workspace-level SOUL.md from overriding global identity without explicit opt-in |
| **S1** | Memory write rate limiting | Cap agent-generated memory entries per session to prevent memory flooding |
| **S2** | Memory write visibility | Surface auto-extracted memories to user for review before persistence |
| **S2** | Encryption at rest (AES-256) | Encrypt memory content on disk; HMAC alone provides integrity, not confidentiality |
| **S3** | Provenance tracking | Record origin chain (session, tool, user action) for each memory entry |
| **S3** | Memory quarantine | Isolate untrusted entries for review before promotion to active memory |
| **S3** | Audit trail | Structured log of agent actions, memory mutations, and permission decisions for compliance |
